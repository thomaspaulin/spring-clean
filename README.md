# Spring Clean
Taking a stab at Python (Python3) by creating script that organizes loose files by extension.

# How it Works
Spring Clean looks at files within the provided directory and bins them in created folders within that directory based off their extension if the `--ext` option is provided, or based off the built in mapping from extension to folder name if `--ext` is not provided.

# Usage
Run springclean.py without arguments for usage instructions.
